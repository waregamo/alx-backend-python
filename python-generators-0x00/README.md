# Python MySQL Seeder

This script connects to a MySQL server, creates a database `ALX_prodev`, and sets up a `user_data` table populated with rows from a CSV file.

## How to Run

1. Update your MySQL credentials in `seed.py`.
2. Make sure `user_data.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run using:
   ```bash
   ./0-main.py
